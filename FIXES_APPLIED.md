**Files Modified**:
- `/src/app/api/scrape/route.ts`
- `/src/app/api/scrape-multiple/route.ts`

**Solution**:
- Added voice preview functionality with ElevenLabs integration

## Usage Instructions

### Testing Screenshot Extraction
1. Enter any URL in the app (e.g., `https://example.com`)

3. Select a voice from the dropdown
4. Click the **Play button** next to the voice selector to hear a preview
5. Enable background music
6. Select a music track
7. Click the **Play button** next to the music selector to hear a preview

### API Keys Required
- **ELEVENLABS_API_KEY**: Required for voice previews and high-quality TTS
- **SHOTSTACK_API_KEY**: Required for video generation
- **VERCEL_BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN**: Required for audio file storage

## Technical Details

### Voice Preview Implementation
```typescript
// Generates audio using ElevenLabs API
const generateVoicePreview = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/generate-audio', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      text: settings.voiceoverScript.slice(0, 200), // Preview first 200 chars
      voiceId: settings.selectedVoice,
    }),
  })
  // Plays generated audio using HTML5 Audio API
}
```

### Enhanced Screenshot Extraction
```typescript
// Better filtering and fallback system
const extractScreenshots = (): string[] => {
  // 1. Try og:image and twitter:image
  // 2. Extract from img tags with filtering
  // 3. Fallback to any images if none found  
  // 4. Add placeholders as last resort
}
```

## Testing Checklist ✅
